**LethalLevelLoaderFixed**
--

**Original mod:** *https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/IAmBatby/LethalLevelLoader/*

A simple fork of LethalLevelLoader that *might* fix some issues on map desync that cause poeple to see differents moons on the monitor and cause client to generate the wrong interior map.

Also resolves the issue of configuration duplication

**Disclaimer** : This mod is intended as a temporary solution until the original LethalLevelLoader mod is updated to resolve these issues.
