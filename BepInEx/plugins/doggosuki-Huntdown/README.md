# Huntdown

### Only the host needs this mod for it to work!

Each time you go to a moon, a mission is given to hunt down a specific monster which drops a difficulty dependent reward when hunted. Almost everything is configurable. A config file is generated after you first open the game with the mod installed.

Please note that if you get a mission to hunt down a creature, it is referring to one specific creature within the facility rather than any of that type. For example, if you are tasked with hunting down a Thumper, and there are two Thumpers within the facility, only one of them is your target.

Your mission will be displayed to all members of your team in the chat once you go to a moon where enemies can spawn. The host can use the terminal command 'target' to get a reminder of what they are hunting.

**Huntable Monsters:**
- Snare Flea
- Hoarding Bug
- Thumper
- Bunker Spider
- Bracken
- Nutcracker
- Masked
- <details><summary>A good boy inside the facility...? (Spoiler)</summary>An Eyeless Dog but indoors</details>
- <details><summary>The Bug Mafia (Spoiler)</summary>A bunch of Hoarding Bugs with shovels</details>
- <details><summary>Blunderbug (Spoiler)</summary>A Hoarding Bug with a shotgun (WIP)</details>
- <details><summary>Infestation (Spoiler)</summary>A bunch of bugs (1 Bunker Spider, 2 Hoarding Bugs and 2 Snare Fleas in the same area)</details>
- <details><summary>Last Month's Interns (Spoiler)</summary>Four Masked men coming to kill you</details>

**A few minor features are host only due to the base game not networking them:**
- Scanning the hunt target with right click only displays 'TARGET' label for the host
- Using the terminal command 'target' to display only works for the host
