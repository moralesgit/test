# Kast
Adds 1 new moon to the game: 13-Kast.

WARNING: Kast is a late-game moon. Enemy spawns are high and ramp up fast throughout the day. The facility is very large, and the scrap is plentiful.
It is recommended to use this mod with other late-game mods for the best experience and to get the most out of this moon.

# Known Issues
- Manticoils somtimes break and will fly in a stationary position forever.
- Far terrain does not render well for the player camera.
- Stormy weather sometimes infiltrates the facility and strikes objects there.
