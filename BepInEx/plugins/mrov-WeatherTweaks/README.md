# WeatherTweaks

Simple mod that adds a few tweaks to the weather system.

Currently, vanilla weather system is completely random - it means that weather condition can exists for few days in a row, which makes it _not very fun_ to play - this mod aims to fix that.

## Features

- More advanced weather picking system
- Fully synchronized weather between host and clients
- Config file with weighted system
- Fully configurable
- Weathers on a new save try to mimic default vanilla behavior, which didn't happen with any modded moons present
- Uncertain weather mechanic: shown forecast won't always be 100% accurate
- (optional) No certain weather conditions shown mode
- (optional) Always unknown weather mode

## Conditions

Weather calculation operates based on weights defined in the config file.
