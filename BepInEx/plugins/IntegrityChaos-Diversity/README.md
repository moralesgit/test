# Diversity

# Important Message!!!
2.0.0 Is FINALLY out! Phew.... Now what? I am going to take a break for a week for my own health and mental care! What's next? Diversity is a great project that I will keep working on till I can't anymore, but I want to push Diversity further than just a mod... This is why I am happily announcing the early development of my very own game based on the lore of Diversity! I will post previews and such in my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/4APzjc8fNW)!!! For that reason. Diversity updates will become less frequent sadly but not to worry that it'll still be actively be worked on! (Though I am not a machine nor god so it's normal that I can't keep up with the huge demand!)

## What is Diversity?
Diversity is a mod that revamps few aspects of the game. Generally the entities itself.

## What changed?
### This is what Diversity revamps:
- Spiders
- Crawlers
- Bracken
- Centipede
- Dress girl
- The players
- Many more aspects of the game to makes things more scary and interesting!

### This is what Diversity adds:
- The Walker (New ennemy)
- New rooms (Dedicated to the enemies)

## The Spiders & Crawlers
- Added brief slow with a few seconds cooldown to the Spiders and Crawlers when hitting them. (This was added to balance the rail cheese fix.)

## The Bracken
- The Bracken will now stay true to his darkness. He will flicker and turn off all nearby lights and will dim player's flashlights if they're close to the Bracken.
- The lights turned off by the Bracken will naturally turn back on after a minute or 2.
- Trying to forcibly turn back on the lights with the breaker box could cause the Bracken to be angered for a while and causes fear. The power also becomes shut off permanently.
- The Bracken will turn off all nearby radar boosters.
- The Bracken will turn off the breaker box occasionally.
- Taking the apparatus will now immediately anger the Bracken, chasing the player who angered the Bracken.
- The Bracken now has a personal space.

## The Dress girl
- She will haunt your walkie-talkie.
- She now has the ability to isolate you and to give you hallucinations.
- She has new voice lines.

## The Centipedes
- You can now help your friends out whenever a centipede is latched onto their head by spamming the use button if you don't have a shovel. 
- Trying to help free a centipede from a player's head could hurt you.

## The Players
- Players will receive conditions such as broken leg, broken arm, bleeding, blindness, and concussions.
- Players will have true darkness when there are no lights inside, it is recommended to bring a flashlight.
