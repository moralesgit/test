# Jetpack Fall Fix

This mod fixes buggy jetpack fall damage logic.

### List of Fixes

- Fall damage while flying in air
- Fall damage despite a smooth landing
- Fall damage not applying when landing, but after a jump
- Fall damage from previous high flight speed when taking off
- Fall damage when taking off from the ship at the start of a game
- Fall damage when using the jetpack for the first time while moving fast enough

This is a client side mod, so everyone who wants these fixes needs to install this mod.

## Extra: other jetpack mods I recommend
- [JetpackWarning by klepticat & Hamunii](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Hamunii/JetpackWarning/) - Adds visual and audio indicators for when your jetpack may explode.
- [JetpacksCarryBigItems by Hamunii](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Hamunii/JetpacksCarryBigItems/) - Allows the use of the jetpack while holding a two handed item.
