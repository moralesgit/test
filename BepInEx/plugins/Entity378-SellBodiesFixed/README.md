This is just [Cleaning Company mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/malco/CleaningCompany/) but only the code for selling enemies dead bodies.\
Original author of the mod: https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/malco/SellBodies/

## Known Issues
- Bodies do not spawn with the correct rotation relative to the original body.

## V 1.4.0:
- Finally, fixed the issue where the value of the bodies was not synced with the host.
- Now, shotguns also have the value synced with the host.

## V 1.3.0:
- Added a custom icon for bodies when held.
- Changed the position in which the Thumper's body spawns.

## V 1.2.2:
- Small changes to the code, nothing should have changed in terms of gameplay.

## V 1.2.1:
- Fixed all issues caused by only making the original body mesh invisible.
- Changed how the Nutcracker shotgun spawns.

## V 1.2.0:
- The Nutcracker has been reintroduced.
- Enemies should now have a death animation before being turned into collectible bodies.
- Fixed a bug where the Nutcracker shotgun would appear at the initial spawn location of the Nutcracker after its death.
- Fixed a bug where the Nutcracker would not drop ammunition upon death.
- Fixed a bug where the Spider webs would remain indestructible after the Spider death.

## V 1.1.0:
- Changed the model of the Bracken remains.
- Changed the position of the Thumper's body when carrying it. This should fix the body drop position (previously it was dropped too far to the left).

## V 1.0.1:
- Fixed a bug where the mod tried to load the Nutcracker body.

## V 1.0.0:
- Fixed the Baboon Hawk bugged price.
- Removed Nutcracker body due to issues with shotgun and shells drop.

In the config you can change the amount of credits the bodies are worth, the weight of the bodies, and which mobs can spawn bodies.
