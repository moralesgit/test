# 1.1.10
- Hopefully fixed an error with network prefabs
- Refactored code (no real effect on the mod)

# 1.1.9
- Fixed a bug with loading levels introduced in 1.1.2
- Fixed a bug in LethalLevelLoader breaking the switch command on the terminal.

# 1.1.8
- Changed some paths in LethalLevelLoader to actually find the plugin folder correctly.

# 1.1.7
- Renamed LethalLevelLoader back again and changed some stuff to make it load correctly. :D

# 1.1.6

  - Moon prices are now directly received from AdvancedCompany, making AdvancedCompany a hard dependency for the LLL fork
  - Dependency for the fork of LLL of LethalLib was removed

# 1.1.4
- Changed the prevention code for watermark removal detection
- Removed LethalLevelLoader from assembly patching as legally requested by IAmBatby specifically probably making changes to moons added by LethalLevelLoader incompatible due to the greedy nature of LLL.
  - Dont contact me about this. I have no way of changing this. IAmBatby is the only one who can revoke their legal request. AC might add custom moon loading later tho to circumvent the requirement of LLL to do that.

It will still show the wrong prices for ship upgrades and still show deactivated ship upgrades because of it.

# 1.0.10

- Removed debug hotkeys H and J for rescaling the Hotbar
- Fixed the screen observer. The hotbar should now automatically adjust to the screen correctly when the window is resized.

# 1.0.9

- Fixed the missile launcher not working as intended. Dont read further if you want to find it out yourself:
  - If being chased by dogs or giants, they will stop chasing and going to the fireworks
  - If being eaten by a giant the giant will drop you
  - Giants will ignore players and wont pick up players for 5s
  - Dogs will ignore players for around 7s
  - Still makes beautiful fireworks

# 1.0.8

- Fixed the hotbar bug
- Fixed the flipped steam avatars
- Added a new more fitting design for energy indicators

# 1.0.7

- Fixed a bug which resulted in some results on the endscreen not being removed correctly.
- Reworked the inventory slots to make it more consistent and work even better with ReservedSlots
- Added a check if a keybind for flashlight is set and if so removing the flashlight keybind from ReservedSlots
- Player avatars are now loaded during the run asynchronously which should prevent avatars missing in end screen and any hangs.
- Added missing foggy weather multipliers
- Added the ability to save your progress in your profile folder. Allowing you to create multiple profiles with different progress.
- Added the ability to change the hotbar alpha and scale
- Added more settings for when save progress is off to make the progression faster:
  - Starting XP
  - XP multiplier

# 1.0.6

- Fixed a bug which prevented users from inputting into the terminal
- Hopefully fixed a bug with the new endscreen freezing the game
- Added compability with ReservedSlots
- Added the ability to deactivate clothing slots by deactivating all items which can be worn in the config

# 1.0.5

- Fixed a bug with the map which might have led to unexpected behaviour.
- Added cause of death to the end screen.
- Added Coroner for cause of death integration. (If you have Coroner installed, the cause of death is read from that mod instead)

# 1.0.4

- Added a custom end screen to enable lobbies of up to 32 players to be displayed.
- Fixed a bug which prevented from spectating all players when playing with up to 32 players.
- Fixed a bug which prevented the correct names of players to be displayed in lobbys bigger than 4.
- Fixed a configuration bug with the Server/General.cfg. It should now show up correctly. Happy bundling mod packs out there! :)
- Fixed a bug with the synchronization of flashlights. They should now no longer desync.
- Fixed an error in one of the transpilers which could have led to unexpected behaviour when playing with more than 4 players. I am pretty sure by now that 32 players should be stable.

# 1.0.3

- Added configuration to moon prices and weather scrap modifiers, making them deactivateable. Deactivating moon prices will result in the travel discount perk to be disabled too.
- Added configuration to let the server keep track of all player XP and reset it after not meeting the quota. Players wont lose their permanent XP but cant use them in lobbys with this enabled. (SaveProgress in Server/General.cfg)
- Hopefully fixed 32 player lobbys not working for steam lobbies. I hope for feedback on this one :)
- Fixed a configuration error which resulted in default values not being set correctly. All affected configuration values will get overwritten after launching the game for the first time after this update. Affected perks were Critical strike chance and Loot Saver.

# 1.0.2

- Fixed a small bug which was introduced by 1.0.1 preventing the night vision and the jump height perk from working correctly.

# 1.0.1

- Slightly changed the missile launcher to aim more for the middle of the screen. Please give me feedback if it feels better now.
- Improved lobby handling and therefore increasing performance for lobbies smaller than 32 players greatly.
- Fixed wrong configuration paths so you can adjust the configs in ThunderStore correctly now.
- Added the ability to deactivate the bigger lobby patches. Please note: All connectings clients need to synchronize this setting before connecting to the server. I am pretty sure other bigger lobby mods will likely result in incompabilities when playing with more than 4 players but you can try it.
