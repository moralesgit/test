_cubert mod also shown in image_

A new moon based on the game SCP:Secret Lab and located on the facility Site-02. 
"An abandoned lab once known as Site-02. Proceed with caution, entities once contained here now roam its halls."

***
# This moon now uses LethalLevelLoader
This moon has more scrap than Titan but harder difficulty. Current enemy spawns and scrap are new and subject to change, you can help shape the spawn rates in discord. (see the feedback section)
If you want to enable SCP Dungeon Generation on Secret Labs moon simply add ```Secret Labs``` to the FoundationMoonsList config entry on the SCP Dungeon Generation mod. Any custom dungeons using ***Lethal Level Loader*** should work in multiplayer.

Route name ```Secret Labs```.
Route cost: ```700```.
The moon also comes with a custom config to change the route price to your desire.

Check out my other [custom moon](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Zingar/Atlas_Abyss/).

If you also have Lethal Expansion installed, I recommend using Lethal Expansion Core to avoid incompatibility issues.
