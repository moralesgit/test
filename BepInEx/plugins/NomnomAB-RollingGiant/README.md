### Building the project

#### Removing the local plugin package step

Remove the `PreBuild` step in the csproj, and replace the `PostBuild` step with

```cs
<Target Name="PostBuild" AfterTargets="PostBuildEvent">
  <Exec Command="cd $(NetcodePatcherDir)&#xA;NetcodePatcher.dll $(TargetDir) deps/&#xA;xcopy /y /d &quot;$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).dll&quot; &quot;$(GameDir)\BepInEx\plugins\RollingGiant\&quot;&#xA;" />
</Target>
```

Also remove:

```cs
<ItemGroup>
  <Folder Include="plugin\BepInEx\plugins\RollingGiant\" />
</ItemGroup>
```

#### Initial steps

1. Open the .csproj
2. Change `<GameDir>` to where your game is installed
3. Change `<NetcodePatcherDir>` to where you have the [Unity Netcode Patcher](https://github.com/EvaisaDev/UnityNetcodePatcher) extracted

> Can also remove the enter netcode patcher step if you want to use the nuget version instead, but I haven't updated to that yet, so I haven't looked into it

4. Build

When built, it will patch the dll and then copy the dll to the game's plugin folder.

If you don't want the auto-copying to the game directory, then remove this from the `PostBuild` step:

```cs
xcopy /y /d &quot;$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).dll&quot; &quot;$(GameDir)\BepInEx\plugins\RollingGiant\&quot;&#xA;
```
