**Description**
--

### **1.1.0 Has Released! Read The Devlog Here:** *https://github.com/IAmBatby/LethalLevelLoader/wiki/Dev-Logs*

**LethalLevelLoader** is a custom API to support the manual and dynamic integration of custom levels and dungeons in Lethal Company. 
Mod Developers can provide LethalLevelLoader with their custom content via code or via automatic assetbundle detection, From there LethalLevelLoader will seamlessly load it into the game.

This API is dependant on **LethalLib**, As it was originaly intended to be a direct update to Evaisa & SkullCrusher's mod. 
It has temporaily been split into this secondary release to allow for more unstable releases, in order to stress test it's systems and collect bug reports from active developers and players.

Currently all Item & Scrap related systems have not been implemented in this mod and should use LethalLib's systems instead.

This Mod is Likely To Be Incompataible with **LethalExpansion**, Due To The inherit conflicts involved in changing the same systems.

**How To Use (Users / Players)**
--


  Simply install LethalLevelLoader and LethalLib.


  If a mod using **LethalLevelLoader** supplies a **.lethalbundle** file, **LethalLevelLoader** will automatically find and load it’s content as long as it’s in the /plugins/ folder (Subfolders will be detected)

**How To Use (Modders / Developers)**

  Please refer to the LethalLevelLoader Wiki for documentation on utalising this API for your custom content

**<details><summary>Features</summary>**

<details><summary>Terminal >preview Keyword</summary>
* *LethalLevelLoader now has a new feature added to the Terminal which allows users to change what information is previewed adjacent to each Moon listed in the `MoonsCatalogue`.

* *LethalLevelLoader now has a new feature added to the Terminal which allows users to "Simulate" landing on a Moon. This provides a presentable, lore friendly way to view the possible `DungeonFlow` choices with accurate rarity via the Terminal. To use this feature, use `simulate` and a Moon's name, the same way you would use `route`. LethalLevelLoader now includes a configuration option to switch between viewing the `DungeonFlow`'s rarity via raw value or calculated percentage.*
</details>

<details><summary>LevelHistory</summary>
* *LethalLevelLoader now has an experimental `LevelHistory` feature that stores notable information regarding each day in the current save. This includes information such as the Level, DungeonFlow, Weather and more. This feature allows modders and future updates to LethalLevelLoader to create mechanics and systems dependant on the history of the current play session.*
</details>

<details><summary>ExtendedDungeonFlow: Host Decides DungeonFlow & DungeonSize</summary>
* *LethalLevelLoader now modifies the way Lethal Company selects the random `DungeonFlow` and it's dungeon size so only the Host client selects these values which is then sent to the remaining non host clients.

</details>

<details><summary>ExtendedLevel: MoonCataloguePages & ExtendedLevelGroups</summary>
* *LethalLevelLoader now completely overhauls how the `MoonsCatalogue` TerminalNode functions internally. `ExtendedLevel`'s are now stored in groups via a class named `ExtendedLevelGroup`, These `ExtendedLevelGroup`'s are then stored in groups via a class named `MoonsCataloguePage`. This overhaul allows other mods and future updates to LethalLevelLoader to control and store `ExtendedLevel`s in many ways that were previously limited.*
</details>

<details><summary>ExtendedLevel: Lock Route</summary>
* *ExtendedLevel's now contain a `isLocked` bool and `lockedNodeText` string that controls whether the Level can currently be routed to via the Terminal.

</details>

<details><summary>ExtendedLevel: Hide Level</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>ExtendedLevel: Provide Level Info Description</summary>
