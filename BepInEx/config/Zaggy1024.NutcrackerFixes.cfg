[Shotgun]

## Synchronize the shotgun shell count and safety setting upon picking up the shotgun. This feature must be installed and enabled for everyone, or the safety will not function as expected. Fixes an issue where too many items on the ship would cause the number of loaded shells as well as the safety to be desynced between the server and clients.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
SynchronizeShellsAndSafety = true
